Using Jetpack stats, this widget will display the most popular posts.

== Description ==

Similar to the original native one, this plugin let you define the range of stats to retrieve.
Also you will be able to add the category name of the post.

Finally, this widget will only display posts (and not pages too).
This plugin read the top 100 of posts/pages and keep only the X first POSTS (X = number defined in the widget parameters). So, you can have less posts than requested.

Jetpack is required to work.
A wordpress account and your blog must be linked.
